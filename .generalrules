# General Rules - Development Standards

## General Coding Standards

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities
- Avoid code duplication

### Error Handling
- Always handle potential errors gracefully
- Provide informative error messages
- Validate inputs before processing
- Use try-except blocks where appropriate
- Log errors for debugging

### File Operations
- Always use proper file encoding (UTF-8 for text files)
- Check file existence before reading/writing
- Use context managers (`with` statements) for file operations
- Handle file path differences between operating systems

### Configuration Files
- Use JSON for structured configuration
- Validate JSON structure before use
- Provide default values where appropriate
- Document configuration file formats

### External Tools Integration
- Verify external tool availability before use
- Use absolute paths for external executables when needed
- Handle subprocess errors appropriately
- Provide clear feedback during long-running operations

### Documentation
- Document complex algorithms and processes
- Explain non-obvious code decisions
- Keep README files updated
- Comment on FFmpeg filter complex operations

### Performance
- Optimize for reasonable processing times
- Use appropriate FFmpeg presets for quality/speed balance
- Consider memory usage for large video files
- Provide progress indicators for long operations

### Security
- Validate all file paths
- Avoid command injection vulnerabilities
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use safe subprocess execution methods

### Version Control
- Commit related changes together
- Write clear commit messages
- Don't commit large binary files (videos, audio)
- Use .gitignore for output files and temporary data
